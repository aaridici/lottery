PHP Lottery Script
=======

I coded this simple lottery script about 10 years ago. It was integrated into a bigger website with user logins. Therefore, the script looks for user logins.

There may be errors with the script and it may not be up to date with PHP. All I did was to revise it and translate it to English before uploading it to here.

I did not test it on my servers.

Also I do not include a database dump (or a creation script). It should be very easy to setup.

$_GET["L"] is the number on the ticket i.e. if there are 1-64 tickets L is between 1-64 inclusive.
